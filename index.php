                <p>I'm a 21 year old Carleton University student who loves web development, speedy performance, and open source. I always like to keep things as simple as possible: simple, but effective! </p>
                <p>I love giving back to the web dev community by giving talks, organizing events and contributing to my favorite open source projects!</p>

                <p>After going to even more meetups, such as Refresh Ottawa ones organized by Shopify team members, I was impressed by how much they like teaching and speaking to people who are interested in web development!</p>
                <p>I, similarly, have had a blast organizing and speaking at workshops at Carleton that were for students in my program who were interested in web development.</p>
                <p>The workshops were started by myself and some alumni as we felt our program lacked any further instruction for web development!</p>

              <p>I have read that no matter what, Shopify strives to make 4 months of experience worth its weight in years of experience anywhere else. </p>
              <p>Shopify will for sure be the best learning and life experience for me!</p>
